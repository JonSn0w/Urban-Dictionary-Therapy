## Setup:
This package requires that you have Python3, as well as BeautifulSoup4. On OS X and Linux systems Python3 should be installed by default. Once Python is installed you can download BeautifulSoup with the command:
```
>$ pip3 install bs4
```
***Note:*** To my knowledge, Python3 is also installed by default with the new **Bash on Windows** linux-subsystem for Windows 10.
